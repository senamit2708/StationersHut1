 exception i found


 1.  Null pointer Exception on .setOnClickListener

--its because of on button  findviewbyId(R.id.butoon_submit);
i used some othere id here..from another class...thats why this error occured.

2. Caused by: android.content.res.Resources$NotFoundException: String resource ID #0x0

---  int num =  cursor.getCount();
           txtCountNumber.setText(num);  --writting this this error occured (heretxtCountNumeber is TexView txtCountNUmber)

      the problem is solver like this
      productCount.setText("The total num is" + num);

      I dont know why



 why i want content provider in my app:

 You want to implement the AbstractThreadedSyncAdapter, CursorAdapter, or CursorLoader classes.

attribute name of content provider

To avoid conflicts, authority names should use a Java-style naming convention (such as com.example.provider.cartoonprovider). Typically, it's the name of the ContentProvider subclass that implements the provider
There is no default.
